# Treehouse React Basics Course Project

___
The app is hosted [HERE](https://simplyphy.github.io/Treehouse_ReactBasics/).

This repo includes the completed html, css, and jsx files provided from the [React Basics Treehouse Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-basics).

The app_myVersion.jsx is my version of the app from this course, created exclusively by following along instructor Jim Hoskins's work.  My app should be an exact copy of his work, if no typos are present.
